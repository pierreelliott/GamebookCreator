# GamebookCreator

## Description

The goal of the project is to make creation of gamebook and visual novel easier. You don't need to know on which platform you want your adventure to be available, it is available on all platform (currently, only web). You also don't need programming skills because you only create the text and manage how it will appear to the viewer.

## Functionalities

- Create situations and add text or action to them
- Add and manage choices at the end of each situation
- Save your work in a JSON file (which you can open with any text editor)
